#Areas of focus
@Solana Developers for the initial inspiration

⪩Promote Decentralization. 
⪩Create developer tooling, media, content, and community projects focussed on promoting
	and bringing more decentralization to the world at large.
⪩Make everything more censorship resistant. Primarily technical projects and code contributions
	which can help us make one of the most censorship resistant platform for building dApps on.
⪩DAO Tooling: Create coordination, communication, and payments tools for communities building the backbone of their infrastructure.
⪩Education: Create media, programs, events, initiatives, etc., to onboard users, earners, and builders to crypto and Solana.
⪩Developer Tooling: Create tools, programs and hacks making it easier and faster for engineers to built the next generation of dApps on Solana.
⪩Payments: Build payments apps for consumers and businesses, making P2P payments, 
	as well as commerce better integrated with the crypto ecosystem using Solana Pay.
⪩Cause-driven building: We’re also looking to fund projects and research around using crypto to create a more inclusive financial system, 
	and innovative solutions towards climate change.
⪩!yell Security!
⪩Lets make the world a better place

⩗To avoid being contaminated by the atmosphere, the getter must be introduced into the vacuum system in an inactive form during assembly, and activated after evacuation. This is usually done by heat.[7] Different types of getter use different ways of doing this:
   ⪩Flashed getter
   
    The getter material is held inactive in a reservoir during assembly and initial evacuation, and then heated and evaporated, usually by induction heating. The vaporized getter, usually a volatile metal, instantly reacts with any residual gas, and then condenses on the cool walls of the tube in a thin coating, the getter spot or getter mirror, which continues to absorb gas. This is the most common type, used in low-power vacuum tubes.
⪩Non-evaporable getter (NEG)[8]

    The getter remains in solid form.
⪩Coating getter

    A coating applied to metal parts of the vacuum system that will be heated during use. Usually a nonvolatile metal powder sintered in a porous coating to the surface of the electrodes of power vacuum tubes, maintained at temperatures of 200 to 1200 °C during operation.
⪩Bulk getter

    Sheets, strips, wires, or sintered pellets of gas absorbing metals which are heated, either by mounting them on hot components or by a separate heating element. These can often be renewed or replaced.
⪩Getter pump or sorption pump

    In laboratory vacuum systems, the bulk NEG getter is often held in a separate vessel with its own heater, attached to the vacuum system by a valve, so that it can be replaced or renewed when saturated.[8]
⪩Ion getter pump

    Uses a high voltage electrode to ionize the gas molecules and drive them into the getter surface. These can achieve very low pressures and are important in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) systems.[8]
