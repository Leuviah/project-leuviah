Achieving Unity
	
Unity Through Similarity

			A person perceives similar objects as a group or whole, 
			whether it be similar shape, size, color, location, angle or value;
			similarity is necessary before difference can be perceived.

	
Unity Through Proximity

		Putting the separate elements close together so that they are seen as a total, 
		related pattern rather than as separate entities.

	
Unity Through Continuation

		Something continues (such as a line, edge or direction) from one form to another, 
		carrying the viewer's eye smoothly from one to the next.

	
Unity Through Closure

		Familiar shapes are more readily seen as complete than incomplete, 
		creating a dynamic connection with the viewer when closure takes place.

	
Unity Through Figure/Ground

		The eye and mind separate an object from its surroundings;
		creating positive and negative space relationships which can be dynamic and ambiguous, 
		offering more than one solution to the eye.

	
Unity Through Repetition

		Elements repeat in various parts of the design to relate the parts to one another:
		can be elements of line, color, shape, direction, type, etc.

		machine⩶rePae with aToken in case the underlying is locked in pool.
		Example: User have stable DAI debt and also holds aDAI
		The user in this case can use aDAI to repay debt in single epoch 
		without any approvals or having to withdraw their supplied liquidity 
		to the poolusing repayWithATokens feature.
		import { Contract, utils } from "ethers";
		const poolAbi = require("./abis/pool.json");
		const pool = new Contract(POOL_ADDRESS, poolAbi, signer);
		// repay amount of DAI debt using aDAI tokens
		pool.repayWithATokens(DAI.address, amount, 2);
		// User must hold aDAI >= amount being rePae

	Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to process information.
	Unlike classical computers that store information in bits that can only be in one state at a time (either 0 or 1), 
	quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can be in multiple states simultaneously.

	This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.
	For example, a quantum computer could factor large numbers much more efficiently than a classical computer,
	which is important for many cryptography applications.

	Quantum computers rely on a concept called superposition, which allows a qubit to exist in multiple states at once,
	and entanglement, which allows qubits to be connected in a way that their states are correlated with each other.

# Areas of focus
@Solana Developers for the initial inspiration
		
	⪩Promote Decentralization. 
	⪩Create developer tooling, media, content, and community projects focussed on promoting
		and bringing more decentralization to the world at large.
	⪩Make everything more censorship resistant. Primarily technical projects and code contributions
		which can help us make one of the most censorship resistant platform for building dApps on.
	⪩DAO Tooling: Create coordination, communication, and payments tools for communities building the backbone of their infrastructure.
	⪩Education: Create media, programs, events, initiatives, etc., to onboard users, earners, and builders to crypto and Solana.
	⪩Developer Tooling: Create tools, programs and hacks making it easier and faster for engineers to built the next generation of dApps on Solana.
	⪩Payments: Build payments apps for consumers and businesses, making P2P payments, 
		as well as commerce better integrated with the crypto ecosystem using Solana Pay.
	⪩Cause-driven building: We’re also looking to fund projects and research around using crypto to create a more inclusive financial system, 
		and innovative solutions towards climate change.
	⪩!yell Security!
	⪩Lets make the world a better place

			💎 What we're going to do
			We're going to build a web app for people to: connect their wallet → 
			mint a membership NFT → receive a token airdrop → and actually 				
			vote on proposals. The web app is what I'll be calling our  "DAO Dashboard".
			It's where our new members can join and it allows existing 			
			members to see what the DAO is up to.

		🤯 Replit!
We'll be using this thing called Replit! It is a browser-based IDE that lets us easily build web apps and deploy them all from the browser. 
It is super legit. Instead of having to set up a full local environment and write commands to deploy, it's all just given to us.

⩗To avoid being contaminated by the atmosphere, the getter must be introduced into the vacuum system in an inactive form during assembly, and activated after evacuation. This is usually done by heat.[7] Different types of getter use different ways of doing this:
   ⪩Flashed getter
   
    The getter material is held inactive in a reservoir during assembly and initial evacuation, and then heated and evaporated, usually by induction heating.
    The vaporized getter, usually a volatile metal, instantly reacts with any residual gas, and then condenses on the cool walls of the tube in a thin coating,
    the getter spot or getter mirror, which continues to absorb gas. This is the most common type, used in low-power vacuum tubes.
⪩Non-evaporable getter (NEG)[8]

    The getter remains in solid form.
⪩Coating getter

    A coating applied to metal parts of the vacuum system that will be heated during use. Usually a nonvolatile metal powder sintered in a porous coating to the surface of the electrodes of power vacuum tubes, maintained at temperatures of 200 to 1200 °C during operation.
⪩Bulk getter

    Sheets, strips, wires, or sintered pellets of gas absorbing metals which are heated, either by mounting them on hot components or by a separate heating 
    element. These can often be renewed or replaced.
⪩Getter pump or sorption pump

    In laboratory vacuum systems, the bulk NEG getter is often held in a separate vessel with its own heater, attached to the vacuum system by a valve
    , so that it can be replaced or renewed when saturated.[8]
⪩Ion getter pump

    Uses a high voltage electrode to ionize the gas molecules and drive them into the getter surface. These can achieve very low pressures and are important in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) systems.[8]
